### State Vector Representation in Quantum Computing

In quantum computing, the state of a quantum system is represented by a **state vector** in a complex vector space. A quantum state \(|\psi\rangle\) is typically described as a superposition of basis states:  

\[
|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
\]

where **\(\alpha\)** and **\(\beta\)** are complex numbers that satisfy the normalization condition:  

\[
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
\]

For an **n-qubit system**, the state vector exists in a **\(2^n\)-dimensional Hilbert space**, allowing quantum parallelism and entanglement. Measurements collapse the state vector into a basis state with probabilities given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.
